# FIESTAnalysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`FIESTAnalysis` is an extension of the `R` package `FIESTA` (Forest Inventory ESTimation and Analysis) that includes "analysis functions" to perform analyses for specific goals, often with the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program in mind.  

## Installation

You can install the released version of FIESTAnalysis from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("graysonwhite/FIESTAnalysis")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(FIESTAnalysis)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
