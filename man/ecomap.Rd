\description{
Contains regional geographic delineations for analysis of ecological
relationships across ecological units. ECOMAP is the term used for a USDA
Forest Service initiative to map ecological units and encourage their use in
ecosystem-based approaches to forest land conservation and management. It is
coordinated at the national and regional levels by USDA Forest Service staff
and implemented in cooperation with State forestry agencies and others.
ECOMAP mapping criteria are outlined in the National Hierarchical Framework
of Ecological Units (https://www.ncrs.fs.fed.us/gla/reports/hierarch-
y.htm). The framework systematically divides the country into progressively
smaller areas of land and water that have similar physical and biological
characteristics and ecological processes.

\details{
The EcoMap Provinces feature class contains ecological province polygons
attributed with names and descriptions. The EcomapSections 2007 data set
describes the ecological sections within the conterminous United States. The
EcomapSubections 2007 data set describes the ecological subsections within
the conterminous United States.
